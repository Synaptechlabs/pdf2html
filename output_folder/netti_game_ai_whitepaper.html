   Abstract
  </p>
  <p>
   Netti-AI introduces a novel architecture for AI systems that simulate cognition, memory, and emotion-making
  </p>
  <p>
   it particularly suited for next-generation game AI. This white paper explores how Netti-AI's memory graphs,
  </p>
  <p>
   mood vectors, and episodic recall enable characters that adapt, evolve, and behave with greater human-like
  </p>
  <p>
   nuance.  We  present  scenarios,  benefits,  and  integration  strategies  for  developers  seeking  more  intelligent
  </p>
  <p>
   and immersive AI agents.
  </p>
  <p>
   1. Introduction
  </p>
  <p>
   Game  AI  is  often  limited  by  scripted  logic  and  reactive  behaviors.  Players  quickly  learn  the  boundaries  of
  </p>
  <p>
   NPC intelligence, breaking immersion. Netti-AI offers an alternative: agents that learn from experience, recall
  </p>
  <p>
   previous encounters, and change behavior based on emotional state. This paper proposes that emotionally
  </p>
  <p>
   driven, memory-enabled agents are key to the future of cognitive gameplay.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. Key Netti-AI Features for Games
  </p>
  <p>
   - Memory Graphs: Store symbolic and emotional context across sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Mood Modulation: Adjust behavior based on fear, trust, anger, curiosity.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Episodic Recall: Enable NPCs to reference past events and dialogue.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Contextual Prediction: Anticipate player behavior based on token associations.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Symbolic Reasoning: Support abstract logic, planning, or quest memory.
  </p>

   3. Use Case Scenarios
  </p>
  <p>
   - Dynamic Quest Givers: Remember player choices, trustworthiness, mood during interactions.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Allies with Personality: Companions who get annoyed, happy, or suspicious over time.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Evolving Enemies: Bosses that adapt tactics based on how they were previously beaten.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Ambient NPCs: Populate towns with residents who remember rumors or past conversations.
  </p>
  <p>
   4. Implementation Layers
  </p>
  <p>
   Netti-AI can run as:
  </p>
  <p>
   - Embedded System: For low-latency agents in real-time games.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Server-Side Simulation: For persistent world memory and large-scale interaction graphs.
  </p>
  <p>
   - Hybrid Plugin: With hooks into Unity/Unreal to offload cognition logic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Developers interact with Netti's CLI or future API to train and export agent states.
  </p>
  <p>
   5. Benefits Over Traditional AI
  </p>
  <p>
   - Removes reliance on state machines
  </p>
  <p>
   - Enables emergent behavior
  </p>
  <p>
   - Offers persistent NPC memory across sessions
  </p>
  <p>
   - Adds emotional depth to scripted events
  </p>
  <p>
   - Facilitates storytelling through natural, unscripted interactions
  </p>
  <p>
   6. Roadmap for Game Integration
  </p>
  <p>
   - 2025 Q3: Exportable game agent profiles
  </p>
  <p>
   - 2025 Q4: Netti-Unity integration module
  </p>
  <p>
   - 2026: AI/NPC co-authoring toolkit with TALIA frontend
  </p>
  <p>
   7. Conclusion
  </p>
  <p>
   Game experiences are elevated when NPCs behave with memory, emotion, and reasoning. Netti-AI bridges
  </p>
  <p>
   that  gap.  With  symbolic  memory  graphs  and  mood-driven  logic,  developers  gain  access  to  AI  systems  that
