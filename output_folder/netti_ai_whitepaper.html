   Abstract
  </p>
  <p>
   Netti-AI  is  a  biologically-inspired  cognitive  engine  that  simulates  essential  aspects  of  human-like  cognition
  </p>
  <p>
   through symbolic neural structures, memory activation pathways, and emotion-aware processing. Built in C++
  </p>
  <p>
   with  modular  extensibility,  Netti-AI  supports  real-time  prediction,  emotional  state  modeling,  and  associative
  </p>
  <p>
   learning. This white paper outlines the motivation, design, architecture, and potential applications of Netti-AI
  </p>
  <p>
   as a foundation for adaptive, conscious-like artificial intelligence systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   1. Introduction
  </p>
  <p>
   Contemporary artificial intelligence excels at scale but struggles with symbolic reasoning, long-term memory,
  </p>
  <p>
   and  emotional  nuance.  Most  systems  are  stateless,  reactive,  and  unable  to  evolve  contextually  over  time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Netti-AI  proposes  a  new  approach:  an  engine  that  models  memory  as  activation  pathways,  emotions  as
  </p>
  <p>
   mood state vectors, and reasoning as symbolic association.
  </p>
  <p>
   Netti-AI isn't just a neural network; it's a simulation of cognition.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. Background
  </p>
  <p>
   Recent progress in deep learning has produced powerful models for pattern recognition and generative tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
   However,  such  models  are  often  opaque,  lack  agency,  and  are  difficult  to  interpret  or  guide.  Classical
  </p>
  <p>
   symbolic AI, while interpretable, lacks adaptability.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Netti-AI combines:
  </p>
  <p>
   - Symbolic tokenization
  </p>
  <p>
   - Dynamic neural links with weighted activation
  </p>
  <p>
   - Hebbian learning mechanisms
  </p>
  <p>
   - Mood-emotion feedback loops
  </p>
  <p>
   - Episodic memory and recall
  </p>
  <p>
   3. System Architecture
  </p>
  <p>
   Core Components:
  </p>
  <p>
   - Tokenizer: Converts input into tagged tokens (e.g., word:cat, punc:?, mood:happy)
  </p>
  <p>
   - Neuron Network: Nodes represent concepts, states, or symbols; links are weighted and directional
  </p>
  <p>
   - Activation Engine: Simulates propagation, feedback, inhibition, and decay
  </p>
  <p>
   - Memory System:
  </p>
  <p>
   - Short-Term Context Window
  </p>
  <p>
   - Long-Term Linkage Persistence
  </p>
  <p>
   - Episodic Archive
  </p>
  <p>
   - Mood Layer: A distributed vector influencing prediction pathways and link strength
  </p>
  <p>
   - CLI Interface: Enables human-readable interaction, training, and inspection
  </p>
  <p>
   4. Features
  </p>
  <p>
   - Token-based memory activation
  </p>
  <p>
   - Emotionally modulated reasoning
  </p>
  <p>
   - Episodic tagging and recall
  </p>
  <p>
   - Mood feedback loop (mood &lt;-&gt; context)
  </p>
  <p>
   - Symbolic math and structured logic tagging
  </p>
  <p>
   - Graph export (Graphviz)
  </p>
  <p>
   - Embedded-ready C++ architecture
  </p>
  <p>
   5. Use Cases
  </p>
  <p>
   - Conversational agents with memory and personality (e.g., TALIA)
  </p>
  <p>
   Netti-AI: White Paper
  </p>
  <p>
   - Embedded robotics with adaptive behavior (e.g., SNL-1)
  </p>
  <p>
   - Cognitive game AI with emotional state
  </p>
  <p>
   - Research tools for cognitive science and artificial memory systems
  </p>
  <p>
   - Real-time feedback systems that adapt based on affective state
  </p>
  <p>
   6. Roadmap
  </p>
  <p>
   - v0.3.2 (2025 Q2): Mood feedback, math tagging, association snapshots
  </p>
  <p>
   - v0.4.0 (2025 Q3): Modular plugins, external sensors, reinforcement hooks
  </p>
  <p>
   - v1.0.0 (2026): API release, docs, stable builds for public and partners
  </p>
  <p>
   7. Future Work
  </p>
  <p>
   - Visual memory and spatial awareness
  </p>
  <p>
   - Language grounding and narrative modeling
  </p>
  <p>
   - Integration with TALIA frontend for cognitive assistant simulation
  </p>
  <p>
   - Emotion-encoded memory prioritization
  </p>
  <p>
   8. Conclusion
  </p>
  <p>
   Netti-AI aims to shift the paradigm from statistical pattern recognition to cognition simulation. Through mood,
  </p>
  <p>
   memory,  and  symbolic  association,  it  offers  a  more  human-centric  model  of  intelligence.  We  invite
  </p>
  <p>
   collaborators,  researchers,  and  developers  to  build  with  Netti-AI  and  help  define  the  next  generation  of
  </p>
  <p>
   adaptive machines.
